## Abstract: 
Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become an increasingly powerful tool for the structural determination of membrane-bound proteins. Structure-based virtual screening for transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) — a target of growing therapeutic interest due to its implication in various disease and pain states, including dentin hypersensitivity and cancer — has significantly progressed as a result of this. This small-scale study explores the potential for improved docking performance using cryo-EM maps as an integral part of TRPM8 structures, utilising the recently developed ‘ChemEM’ software by Sweeney and colleagues. We compare ChemEM with the classical docking tool Smina, subsequently employing MLSFs for ranking. Despite software limitations, our findings indicate that while cryo-EM map incorporation shows little significance, the ChemEM scoring function demonstrates superior performance compared to Smina. Future software iterations could enable more comprehensive virtual screening, allowing exploration of ultra-large chemical libraries and potentially advancing TRPM8-targeted drug discovery.
